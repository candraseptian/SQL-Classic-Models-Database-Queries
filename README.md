# SQL-Classic-Models-Database-Queries
SQL queries on Classic Models database by www.richardtwatson.com.

I learn how to solve SQL queries by practising "Belajar MySQL/Maria DB" playlist by Guntur Budi (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF82-I80PwDN7KSzsJOmd8mwHYe4aAqfF). The Classic Models database is originated from www.richardtwatson.com and can be downloaded on (https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx/).

I exercise to write SQL queries in a relational databases in three cardinality: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many. And I use MySQL workbench as my SQL client. Overall, it's a good exercises with explanations.
